# django-dog-and-cat-image-classification

A simple Django web application that uses machine learning to recognize image if cat or dog

Notes for deployment:

- 'static' folder is generated using `python manage.py collecstatic`
- Procfile is needed also for deployment (setting up gunicorn)
- runtimetxt is for checking the correct python version for deployment

The Notebook I used for creating the deep learning model:
